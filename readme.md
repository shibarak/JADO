#The Jedi Academy Droput#
##A website I created for the Udemy course "100 Days of Python"##

Things I Implemented: HTTP Requests, Public APIs, Flask, Pillow, spacy, HTML 5 video, a little javascript and css

The assignment was to creat a website using an API. I decided to use the "Kanye as a Service" API to get kanye quotes which I then translated to Yoda-speak with funtranslations Yoda API.  Once I had the translation I used Pillow to put the text on some photoshopped Kanye-as-Yoda (Kanyod Weest) images and create memes which are then output to the website.  I also created a little satirical Starwars opening scroll that plays on the landing page explaining the project and giving some backstory to Kanyod.

Fun project overall! You can check out the completed web app at : https://the-jado.herokuapp.com/

At least until my one month of access to the Yoda API runs out (5.99 a month for that is criminal).

To do: Try to use spacy and NLP to do code my own Yodish translator.
